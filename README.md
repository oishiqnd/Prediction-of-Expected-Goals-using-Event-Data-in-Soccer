# Football xG Analysis: Beyond the Scoreline

Football matches outcomes are deeply influenced by a mixture of skill, strategy, and sheer luck. Our goal with this project is to minimize the influence of randomness and luck, providing a more data-driven and objective evaluation of team performances. We make use of the Expected Goals (xG) metric, a tool gaining popularity in football analysis, to quantify several key factors that influence the outcome of a match.

## Project Overview
This project aims to study and analyze the performance of football teams by using the xG metric. The xG metric calculates the likelihood of a shot leading to a goal by taking into account several factors like distance from the goal, angle, match scoreline, type of shot (header or foot), whether it was a counter-attack opportunity, among others. By aggregating these opportunities over a match, we can estimate how many goals a team should have scored based on these factors. This data-driven approach allows us to understand and quantify the underlying performance of a team beyond mere outcomes.

## Goals
Our goals for this project include:

- Implementing an xG model that takes into account various factors influencing a shot's chance of becoming a goal.
- Providing a more objective, data-driven evaluation of football team performances.
- Applying our xG model to analyze individual matches, series of games, entire seasons, and manager tenures.
